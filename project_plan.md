# Project Plan
## Transfer Learning

Idea v1.0:
To try and check how pretraining affects the predictive ability of TL models. I want to look into the relationships between different values (Melting Point, LogP, etc.).

Phase 1:
Use different pre-trained models like ChemBERTa-3 to train models on different experimental values (logD or bp etc) to try and predict toxicity.
