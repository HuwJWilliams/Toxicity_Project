These performance metrics were made using two different descriptor/embedding sets (set 1 and set 2).
The pipeline trains RFs on all of set 1 and predicts each column in set 2, treating each as a target value.
This gives you insight into how much information for each descriptor/embedding in set 2 is already captured in set 1.

Experimental:

    -   Trained on 1000 for each descriptor set

    -   Descriptors: RDKit, Mordred
    -   Embeddings: MolFormer, ChemBERTa

    "min_samples_split": [2, 5],
    "min_samples_leaf": [2, 4, 8],
    }
